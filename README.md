This is a small web apllication that I made as a companion to another web apllication I made as a school project for solving nonograms.
This application lets you design nonogram motives via an interactive user interface in the browser. When you are done designing, you can dowload the design to a JSON file.
The JSON file can be imported to the nonogram solver. When the project is properly set up it would take the JSON files and save them as BSON files in MongoDB. This is a project from early on in my learning journey.
